# Depolymerase-Predictor (DePP)

A machine learning software package that assists in the identification of bacteriophage depolymerases. Requires the installation of Scikt-Learn, BioPython, and Numpy.

A standalone version of the software is available both in this repository and on SourceForge which contains the required dependencies. This code and the training set are available so that experienced users can make modifications to refine the model, especially as new sequences become available. We will be updating this package continously as new experimentally verified depolymerases become available.

The intended use of the software is to narrow the selection of potential genes linked to observed depolymerase activity to better direct lab work. It can however be absolutely applied to more complex datasets such as metagenomes.
