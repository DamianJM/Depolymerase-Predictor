# Depolymerase-Predict

A machine learning software package that assists in the identification of bacteriophage depolymerases. Requires the installation of Scikt-Learn, BioPython, and Numpy.

A standalone version of the software is available on SourceForge which contains the required dependencies. This code and the training set are available so that
experienced users can make modifications to refine the model, especially as new sequences become available.
